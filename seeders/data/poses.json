			"description": "From a standing position with the feet together, the weight of the body is shifted to balance on one leg.  The opposite foot is then clasped with both hands and lifted up by pulling the knee in towards the chest.  Fingers are interlaced under the sole of the foot, specifically at the arch.  Avoid placing the thumbs on the tops of the feet.  The standing leg is straight, but the knee joint is not locked.  The standing foot is rooted firmly into the earth while the weight is shifted slightly forward, closer to the ball of the foot, not the heel.  The bent knee then extends straight until it is parallel with the earth.  Maintain balance in the pose with good pranayama (breath work) and bandhas.  Keep a leveled pelvis.  It is helpful to think about extending the foot up rather than out.  Continue to lengthen the spine from the neck down to the tailbone.  Allow the shoulders to fall into their natural position away from the ears and extend the arms, maintaining the grip on the foot and straightening the leg.  Engage the muscles of the thigh for more stability.  To achieve the full extension of the pose, round the spine and drop the elbows while lowering the head to your knee.  Avoid dropping the abdominals onto your thigh.  Pull the navel up and into the spine while folding forward.  Lower the head to the knee and tuck the chin into the chest into Jalandhara bandha.  This will extend the stretch of the spine up through the neck.  The gaze is towards the knee or out in front.",

			"description": "From a prone position lying on the earth the pelvic bowl is firmly contracted interiorly towards the center line of the body while the pubis is tucked under.  The legs are extended back and the tops of the feet are squared to the earth.  The palms are flat and the fingers are in line with the shoulder blades, or, if possible, the palms are tucked under the shoulders with the elbows bent and tucked into the sides of the body.  On an inhalation, the arms are straightened slightly, maintaining a soft bend in the elbows as the chest lifts off the earth.  Lift up only to the height that is comfortable and that also maintains the pubis and the legs pressed to the earth.  Work the opposing forces by pressing the tailbone towards the pubis as the pubis lifts towards the navel.  The hip points are narrowed.  The buttocks are firm but not hardened.  The shoulder blades are firm against the back.  The side ribs expand to facilitate the back bend.  Lift through the top of the sternum but avoid pushing the front ribs forward, which only hardens the lower back.  Distribute the backbend evenly throughout the entire spine.  The gaze is out in front or straight ahead depending on flexibility.",

The shoulder blades are firm against the back torso and pulled up toward the tailbone.  The upper arms are rotated outward with the eye of the elbow to the front of the room to keep the shoulder blades broad while the outer arms hug inward in opposing forces for balance and stability.

			"slug": "standing-bend-to-right-leg",
			"description": "From a standing position with the feet together, the weight of the body is shifted to balance on one leg.  The opposite foot is then clasped with both hands and lifted up by pulling the knee in towards the chest.  Fingers are interlaced under the sole of the foot, specifically at the arch.  Avoid placing the thumbs on the tops of the feet.  The standing leg is straight, but the knee joint is not locked.  The standing foot is rooted firmly into the earth while the weight is shifted slightly forward, closer to the ball of the foot, not the heel.  The bent knee then extends straight until it is parallel with the earth.  Maintain balance in the pose with good pranayama (breath work) and bandhas.  Keep a leveled pelvis.  It is helpful to think about extending the foot up rather than out.  Continue to lengthen the spine from the neck down to the tailbone.  Allow the shoulders to fall into their natural position away from the ears and extend the arms, maintaining the grip on the foot and straightening the leg.  Engage the muscles of the thigh for more stability.  To achieve the full extension of the pose, round the spine and drop the elbows while lowering the head to your knee.  Avoid dropping the abdominals onto your thigh.  Pull the navel up and into the spine while folding forward.  Lower the head to the knee and tuck the chin into the chest into Jalandhara bandha.  This will extend the stretch of the spine up through the neck.  The gaze is towards the knee or out in front.",

Then lift the head, upper torso, arms, and legs away from the earth while resting the weight of the body on the lower ribs, belly, and front pelvis.  Firm the buttocks and reach strongly through the legs, first through the heels to lengthen the back legs, then through the bases of the big toes.  Keep the big toes turned toward each other.

			"description": "From an arm balance position the weight of the body is supported on one side and distributed equally between the bottom arm and foot while the other (top) arm lifts with fingers spread wide and the other (top) foot stacks on top.  The top foot is raised up toward the sky and the top hand reaches over to grasp the toes.  The grounded (bottom) foot is flat and gripping the earth from the outside edge of the foot.  If flexibility of the foot is limited then instead of gripping the earth with a flat foot, the weight of the body is balanced on the side edge of the foot that is flexed instead of flat.  The arm supporting the weight of the body and the grounded foot actively press into the floor as the shoulder blades firm against the back and then widen away from the spine drawing toward the tailbone.  Bandhas are engaged to maintain balance and stability.  The crown of the head reaches away from the neck and the gaze is up towards the hand.",

The legs are extended back and the tops of the feet are squared to the earth.  The palms are flat and the fingers are in line with the shoulder blades, or, if possible, the palms are tucked under the shoulders with the elbows bent and tucked into the sides of the body.  On an inhalation, the arms are straightened slightly, maintaining a soft bend in the elbows as the chest lifts off the earth.  Lift up only to the height that is comfortable and that also maintains the pubis and the legs pressed to the earth.  Work the opposing forces by pressing the tailbone towards the pubis as the pubis lifts towards the navel.  The hip points are narrowed.  The buttocks are firm but not hardened.  The shoulder blades are firm against the back.  The side ribs expand to facilitate the back bend.  Lift through the top of the sternum but avoid pushing the front ribs forward, which only hardens the lower back.  Distribute the backbend evenly throughout the entire spine.  The gaze is out in front or straight ahead depending on flexibility.",

			"description": "From a prone position lying on the earth the pelvic bowl is firmly contracted interiorly towards the center line of the body while the pubis is tucked under.  The legs are extended back and the tops of the feet are squared to the earth.  The palms are flat and the fingers are in line with the shoulder blades, or, if possible, the palms are tucked under the shoulders with the elbows bent and tucked into the sides of the body.  On an inhalation, the arms are straightened slightly, maintaining a soft bend in the elbows as the chest lifts off the earth.  Lift up only to the height that is comfortable and that also maintains the pubis and the legs pressed to the earth.  Work the opposing forces by pressing the tailbone towards the pubis as the pubis lifts towards the navel.  The hip points are narrowed.  The buttocks are firm but not hardened.  The shoulder blades are firm against the back.  The side ribs expand to facilitate the back bend.  Lift through the top of the sternum but avoid pushing the front ribs forward, which only hardens the lower back.  Distribute the backbend evenly throughout the entire spine.  The gaze is out in front or straight ahead depending on flexibility.",
			"benefits": "Strengthens the spine.  Stretches the chest, the lungs, the shoulders and the abdomen.  Firms the buttocks.  Stimulates the abdominal organs.  Helps relieve stress and fatigue.  Opens the heart and the lungs.  Soothes the sciatica.  Therapeutic for asthma.  Traditional texts say that Bhujangasana increases body heat, destroys disease, and awakens Kundalini.",
